# MicroDexed-touch

## This is a development fork of MicroDexed with TFT Touch Display, "nextgen" UI and advanced sequencer

### This fork requires a Teensy 4.1,  Audio Shield, 480x320 TFT Display ( ILI9486, pseudo SPI),  XPT2046 Touchscreen and serial Flash.


This is a port of the original Dexed/msfa engine (see https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed and https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android) to be used on a Teensy-3.6 or Teensy-4.x.

## License
MicroDexed is licensed on the GPL v3. The msfa component (acronym for music synthesizer for android, see https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android) stays on the Apache 2.0 license to able to collaborate between projects.
